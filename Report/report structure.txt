Fitting a Distribution using R - (Include reference)
	- Show the graph of salary from ipynb. Following explains why it is heavy tailed
	- fitdistrplus package
		Why are we using this? What is this used for?
	- descdist function
		- Cullen and Frey Graph
			Explain the graph
		- Get the most probable distribution
	-fitdist function
		- fit the most probable distribution 
		- Show the graphs
		- Describe about QQ plots and say that lnorm has better QQ plots compared to Weibull
		- Show the AIC values
			[1]Weibull - 107434.9
			[2]lnorm -  106317.6
			lnorm is better (log normal)
		- Describe what is AIC
			lesser AIC - the better - write the reason
		
	-Log normal is heavy tailed distribution. Conclude
